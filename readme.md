BLACKWIRE: Tenfold and the Scar

“Don’t type into the wire.”
“Talk to it properly.”

You’re in the basement lab.

Upstairs the office is still alive—calls, laughter, Slack pings. Down here it’s fluorescent light and cold metal. The kind of cold that makes everything feel like evidence.

Behind the server rack: a weathered black case bolted to the floor like someone expected it to be found… but not opened.

Three modules.
Three names.
One Timer

One port stamped into the steel:

WIRE

A sticky note is attached to the lid:

“A stranger gets silence.”
“A name gets a reply.”
“Keep the replies.”

Below it, in smaller handwriting:

“First: open what’s sealed.”
“Second: trust the stamp.”
“Third: read what machines read.”

And underneath that—written like a warning to the impatient:

“Five bad answers in a row…”
“…and the wire goes quiet.”
“Not for the case.”
“For you.”

You have 30 minutes.

This environment contains:

a Jupyter notebook (your bench)

a folder called casefiles/

an executable called wire

“Tools are allowed.”
“Guessing isn’t.”

The Wire

The case listens only through the wire.

“Introduce yourself once.”
“After that, speak like you belong here.”

Bomb 1 — THE ARCHIVE

### Add a hint for grepping code from one file (KEY keyword)

The first module blinks like a heartbeat.

A strip of tape crosses its face:

“Everything looks the same until you open it.”
“Ten doors, then ten more, then ten more.”
“Depth is where time goes to die.”

Inside casefiles/:

payload.zip

It’s symmetry all the way down.

“One path isn’t pretending.”
“Find the voice that reads like a human wrote it.”

Defuse the first module.
If the case replies—keep what it gives you.

Bomb 2 — THE STAMP

The second module doesn’t blink.

It repeats one line, calmly:

“Name it.”

A cracked note is taped beside it:

“Most records are honest.”
“Some are wrong on purpose.”
“The lie leaves a scar.”

Inside casefiles/:

manifest.csv

stamp.py

Someone wrote one more line under the tape, almost like a dare:

“Lots of whispers will claim they’re the truth.”
“Only one whisper sits on a broken stamp.”

Somewhere in the manifest:

one country is consistently “off”

many rows contain rotated-looking whispers

and many of those whispers are bait

“When the stamp is wrong, the margin matters.”
“When the stamp is right, the margin lies.”

Find the city the case is asking for.

Defuse the second module.
If the case replies—keep that too.

Bomb 3 — THE LENS

The third module is silent.

No blink. No display.

Just a metal plate screwed into it:

“Look at the essence.”
“Not the picture.”
“The part engineers never stop seeing.”

Inside casefiles/:

root.png

“Humans see light.”
“Machines see structure.”

The case has already spoken to you twice.

“This time… the file tells you exactly what to say.”
“If you know where to look.”

Good luck.
