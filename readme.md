# BLACKWIRE

"Don't type into the wire."
"Talk to it properly."

You're in the basement lab—below the noise of the office, below the part of the building that still pretends nothing is wrong.

Upstairs: calls, laughter, Slack pings.
Down here: fluorescent buzz and cold metal.
The kind of cold that makes every surface feel like evidence.

Behind the server rack, bolted to the floor, is a black case with corners worn smooth—like it's been handled by people who never wrote their names down.

Three modules.
Three labels.
One timer.

A single port is stamped into the steel:

**WIRE**

A sticky note is attached to the lid. The handwriting is neat, almost kind:

"A stranger gets silence."
"A name gets a reply."
"Keep the replies."

Beneath it, in smaller ink:

"First: open what's sealed."
"Second: trust the stamp."
"Third: read what machines read."

And underneath that—written like a warning to the impatient:

"Five bad answers in a row…"
"…and the wire goes quiet."
"Not for the case."
"For you."

You have **60 minutes**.

This environment contains:
- a Jupyter notebook (your bench)
- a folder called `casefiles/`
- an executable called `wire`

"Tools are allowed."
"Guessing isn't."

## THE WIRE

The case listens only through the wire.

"Introduce yourself once."
"After that, speak like you belong here."

The wire does not negotiate.
It only *records*.

---

## BOMB 1 — TENFOLD ARCHIVE

The first module blinks like a slow heartbeat.

A strip of tape crosses its face:

"Ten doors, then ten more, then ten more."
"Everything matches."
"Everything wants you to waste time."

Inside `casefiles/`:
- `payload.zip`

The archive is perfect repetition—folders stacked like mirrors, files cut from the same mold.
Same sizes. Same names. Same silence.

A smaller note is wedged under the tape, its edges worn from handling:

"Don't open every door."
"Most locks are decoration. One isn't."
"The answer's already written somewhere inside."

And at the bottom, in different ink:

"The case doesn't want your interpretation. It wants what it asked for."

The rest are there to make you doubt your tools.

Find what doesn't repeat. Bring it back exactly as it appears.

## BOMB 2 — THE STAMP

The second module doesn't blink.

It repeats one line, calmly, like a clerk who has seen too many forged documents:

"Name it."

A cracked note is taped beside it:

"Most records are honest."
"Some are wrong on purpose."
"The lie leaves a scar."

Inside `casefiles/`:
- `manifest.csv`
- `stamp.py`

Someone has added a sentence beneath the tape, almost like a dare:

"Records don't confess. They fail their audits."

A second scrap is pinned underneath, written in a different hand:

"Start with what can't afford to be wrong."
"The validation doesn't lie—when it breaks, follow the break."

And next to it, a smudged diagram of concentric circles:

"Some messages arrive shifted."
"The alphabet is a wheel. Twenty-six positions."
"Turn it until the noise becomes signal."

The manifest holds dozens of entries—all look identical at first glance.
But someone wasn't careful enough.
One record contradicts its own proof.

Inside that record, something whispers in the wrong direction.
Most whispers stay garbled no matter how you listen.
But one aligns when you know which way to turn.

When it clears, you'll recognize it.

The case is waiting for the place that couldn't hide its mistake.

"Name it."

## BOMB 3 — THE LENS

The third module is silent.

A metal plate across its face:

"Look beneath the surface."
"Not what's shown—what's embedded."

Inside `casefiles/`:
- `root.png`

A scorched note on the back:

"Every file remembers how it was made."
"The picture is a distraction."

"The case has been teaching you its language."
"This file speaks it too."

And at the bottom:

"Incomplete sentences wait for what came before."

The image won't yield to strangers.
